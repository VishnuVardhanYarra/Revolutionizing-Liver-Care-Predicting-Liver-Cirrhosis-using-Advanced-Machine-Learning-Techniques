## ✅ Activity 1: Specify the Liver Cirrhosis Results

Liver cirrhosis is a long-term liver disease that results in the scarring of liver tissues. It progresses slowly and often shows symptoms only in the later stages, which makes early diagnosis very important. 

Using a machine learning model, we aim to identify patients who are at risk of liver cirrhosis using their clinical and biochemical data. The prediction model should be able to detect patterns in data and classify whether a patient is likely to have cirrhosis or not. The expected result is to build a classification model that provides at least 70% accuracy, allowing it to be useful for clinical assistance.

## ✅ Activity 2: Business Requirements

To meet the objectives of this project, the following business requirements are identified:

- Develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify liver disease status.
- Use real clinical data to train the model.
- Ensure the model can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.
- Deploy the model into a simple user-friendly interface using Flask.
- Save time, reduce cost, and improve accuracy of liver disease diagnosis.

## ✅ Activity 3: Literature Survey

Several research works have already explored the use of machine learning for liver disease detection:

1. **Prediction of Liver Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms (2021)**  
   This study applied Random Forest and Decision Tree models on the Indian Liver Patient Dataset. They found that Random Forest achieved around 71% accuracy and concluded that early-stage liver detection is feasible through machine learning.

2. **An Analysis of Liver Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning (IJERT 2020)**  
   The researchers tested algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN. They emphasized that liver enzymes and protein ratios were among the most important features for prediction.

3. **Liver Disease Detection Using Hybrid Models (Springer, 2022)**  
   This paper explored hybrid models combining feature selection with ensemble techniques and reported improved model accuracy, especially with proper data preprocessing.

These surveys show that ML-based classification for liver disease is a viable research area, and our project aligns with existing trends to improve it further.
