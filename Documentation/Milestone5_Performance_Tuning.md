# üß™ Milestone 5: Performance Testing & Hyperparameter Tuning

In this milestone, we evaluate the performance of multiple machine learning models using various metrics and then apply hyperparameter tuning to improve their accuracy and reliability.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Performance Evaluation

We initially trained multiple models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost) in the previous milestone. Each model is now evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

These metrics give a complete understanding of how well each model performs across all classes, especially in the presence of class imbalance.

## üîç Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning

We used `GridSearchCV` to tune the hyperparameters for the best-performing models (Random Forest and XGBoost).

### Example: Random Forest Tuning

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

params = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5]
}

grid_rf = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42), param_grid=params, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

best_rf_model = grid_rf.best_estimator_
print("Best Parameters:", grid_rf.best_params_)
```

### Example: XGBoost Tuning

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

params = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'max_depth': [3, 5],
    'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.01]
}

grid_xgb = GridSearchCV(XGBClassifier(random_state=42), param_grid=params, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)

best_xgb_model = grid_xgb.best_estimator_
print("Best Parameters:", grid_xgb.best_params_)
```

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Compare Before and After Tuning

We observed an improvement of **4‚Äì6% in model accuracy** after tuning, and the F1-score also improved, especially for the minority class.

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Final Model Saving

```python
import joblib

joblib.dump(best_xgb_model, "rf_acc_tuned.pkl")
joblib.dump(scaler, "normalizer_tuned.pkl")
```

These models will be used in the Flask deployment.

### üéØ Summary

- Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved model performance.
- GridSearchCV was used for Random Forest and XGBoost.
- The best-tuned model is saved for integration with the UI.
